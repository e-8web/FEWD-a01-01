<p> To learn web design and review skills, I find W3 Schools extrodinarily helpful, see link:
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3 Schools</a> 
 In contains great links to understanding and learning specific techniques. I also am eager to learn new resources. One that I found recently is <a href="www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a>. 
 </p>
 
 <p> In my spare time I like to spend time in nature and outdoors. One of my favorite botanical species is the magnolia tree. I find the small ones that bloom in the spring fabulous. Nature can also be a great source for inspiration for design. </p>
